# Virtual Reality Headset - Arduino
The final project for this course was to create some device of your choosing using a embedded system. I choose to use and Arduino and the Unity engine to process movement from a nine degrees of freedom IMU breakout chip. This allowed me to track the movements of the headset and adjust accordingly to the three dimensional space created by Unity's engine. I further added a joystick to the project and allowed for movement inside of the engine.

### Equipment:
joystick 
Arduino mega-2560
9df IMU breakout
